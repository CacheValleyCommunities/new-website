This month, we&rsquo;re diving into the world of Raspberry Pi! This is a fantastic opportunity to learn about these tiny but surprisingly powerful devices that have gotten a lot of people excited about DIY tech projects. Raspberry Pi computers come in all shapes and sizes, but are pretty amazing for their size and price and you can do way more with them than you&rsquo;d expect! We&rsquo;ll explore what all the fuss is about and see why these tiny computers have become such a big deal in the tech world.</p><h2 id=why-learn-about-raspberry-pi>Why Learn About Raspberry Pi?</h2><p>The Raspberry Pi is a small sized, low-cost computer that can do almost anything a regular computer can do, from browsing the web to programming and even running servers. Here are some reasons why learning about Raspberry Pi is beneficial:</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s an affordable way to learn programming, electronics, and computer science concepts</li><li>Devices like these are being used everywhere from home automation to industrial applications</li><li>It&rsquo;s a great stepping stone for anyone interested in IoT, robotics, or maker projects</li><li>Raspberry Pi skills are increasingly valuable in tech careers and STEM education</li><li>Learning with Pi can teach you how computers actually work at a fundamental level</li></ul><h2 id=detailed-event-schedule>Detailed Event Schedule</h2><p>Please check the bottom of the article to find a map to the location.</p><h3 id=part-1-general-meetup--networking-45-minutes>Part 1: General Meetup & Networking (45 minutes)</h3><ul><li><strong>1:30 - 1:45 PM</strong>: Welcome, introductions, and community announcements</li><li><strong>1:45 - 2:15 PM</strong>: Open forum discussion on tech career paths<ul><li>Educational journeys: comparing academic vs. self-taught experiences</li><li>Local tech job market insights and opportunities</li><li>Mentorship connections and resource sharing</li></ul></li><li><strong>2:15 - 2:30 PM</strong>: Break and networking opportunity</li></ul><h3 id=part-2-raspberry-pi-presentation-60-minutes>Part 2: Raspberry Pi Presentation (60 minutes)</h3><ul><li><strong>2:30 - 3:30 PM</strong>: Presentation on Raspberry Pi</li></ul><h2 id=community-engagement>Community Engagement</h2><p>The Cache Valley Tech Community is all about creating a fun, supportive space for tech enthusiasts of all levels.

Avoid falling for them by verifying sources, being cautious with unsolicited messages, and protecting personal information. Watch for red flags like suspicious payment methods and unprofessional communication. Stay vigilant, trust your instincts, and report any suspicious activity.</description></item><item><title>Cache Tech Community Meetup - April 2025</title><link>/p/cache-tech-meetup-april-2025/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/p/cache-tech-meetup-april-2025/</guid><description>Join us on &lt;strong>April 26, 2025, at 1:30 PM (MST) at Bridgerland Technical College&lt;/strong> for a tech meetup focused on &lt;strong>self-hosting and privacy&lt;/strong>.

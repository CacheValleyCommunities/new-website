And, this matches what
they're use to seeing in code editors, browsers, applications, and more.</p><p><br>Additionally, we wanted to make sure our site loads for everyone.
Meaning we can't have the latest and greatest website technology and
styling. We depend on basic HTML, CSS, and JS. The result? Even
computers from 2010 can render our page. (though parts might be a bit
visually broken)</p></div><h1>About</h1><p>We're a community resources site. You can find different local communities,

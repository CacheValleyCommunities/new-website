## Event Overview
Join us for a facilitated discussion focused on STEAM education, community involvement, and shared opportunities for students.

- The mutual benefits of engagement between education and industry

The format is a whole-group, facilitator-led discussion. This is not a presentation or recruitment event, and no commitments are expected.

On November 7th and 8th, the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is hosting a tree-planting weekend at the Bear River Massacre site in Idaho. This ongoing project aims to restore the land with native plants and support long-term ecological recovery.

## How to Get Involved

### Volunteer in Person
Anyone is welcome to volunteer for one or both days. You can sign up directly at the [2025 Tree Planting Volunteer Sign-Up page](https://nwbshoshone.com/wuda-ogwa-planting-days/). Registration is individual, and there's even an option to grab a t-shirt if you'd like.

### Support from Afar
If you can't attend in person, the organizers are also raising funds to expand the number of trees planted. Every $25 donation adds another tree to the project.

## Impact

This is a great chance to:
- Contribute your time or resources to something meaningful
- Support Indigenous-led restoration work
- Spend time outdoors doing something tangible for the planet
